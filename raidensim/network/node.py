    Notes:
        * When dealing with channel numbers, these numbers refer to unidirectional channels.
        * "Balance" is the amount of tokens sent from this node to another node. Accordingly,
          a positive balance for node A indicates that A has spent tokens, not gained.
        * Same for "Net balance". If A sent 3 tokens to B, and B sent 1 token to A, A's net balance
          is 2. B's net balance is -2.
        * "Capacity" is the amount of tokens available for spending and takes into account both
          directions of a channel. With the added information that both participants deposited
          5 tokens in their channels, the above example results in capacites 3 and 7 for A and B
          respectively.
        * "Imbalance" is the difference in capacities. On equal deposits this is the same as the
          net balance. Newly created channels always have a net balance of 0 but depending on their
          deposits differ in imbalance.
        * The get_* functions are not optimized for speed and should not be used in performance-
          critical parts of the code (e.g. Dijkstra search). Cache values like these on the graph
          edges for better performance.
